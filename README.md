## Project Overview
This project is a web development task focused on mastering the CSS Box Model and Viewport Units without the use of modern layout tools like Flexbox or Grid. 

### Implementation Details
- HTML Structure: Uses semantic tags and a structured layout for an image and an interactive button.
- CSS Spacing: Achieved 25% spacing from the left and right, and 10% from the top and bottom using Viewport Width ($vw$) and Viewport Height ($vh$) units.
- Box Model: Implemented box-sizing: border-box to ensure padding and borders do not cause unwanted scrolling.
- Styling: Features a custom gradient background for the button and specific font settings.
